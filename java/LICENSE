MSS Code Factory 2.13 is all under the same GPLv3/Commercial
license that I use for most 2.13 projects because you are
really not supposed to be using 2.13 to produce 2.14 code.
The engine for 2.13 is very much under development and unstable,
so unless you have a commercial license or you're working
with GPLv3-compliant code, you shouldn't be using the 2.13
version of the factory itself at all.

Even the knowledge base cartridges that I consider to be
"libraries" of rules are under the GPLv3 at this point in
time, as are all the models for the 2.14 projects.
